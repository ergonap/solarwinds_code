# solarwinds
* A collection of things I like/work on with regards to solarwinds. See this as a giant collection of knowledge.

I would also recommend looking at the following: 
- [Marc Netterfield's MyPubiicWork](https://github.com/Mesverrum/MyPublicWork) as a solid reference to what can be achieved. Some things do tend to break. I moved most of his powershell stuff (and my own) into the powershell folder. 
- [KMSigm'a SWQL and PS Repo](https://github.com/kmsigma/SwqlQueries) - Kevin put together a lot in here, and it's all worth looking through.

I'm also big on 

- [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) and the related:
- [MermaidJS](http://mermaid.js.org/)
  - [Mermaid Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/diagrams-as-code-with-mermaid-github-and-vs-code/)

 - [Me on thwack](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/members/designerfx)
